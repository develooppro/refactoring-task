## Steps to run the project

1. Clone the project.
2. Register on the site https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/ and get the API key for the project
3. Run `make init-dev` to install the dependencies and enter the API key when prompted (or edit it in the .env file later)
4. Run `make run` to run the project on the given data

Note: You need php and composer installed on your machine to run the project.

Note: I sincerely hope, you are using a Unix based system or the MacOS. 
If not, you can still run the project, using the commands in the Makefile the way it is done on Windows.
